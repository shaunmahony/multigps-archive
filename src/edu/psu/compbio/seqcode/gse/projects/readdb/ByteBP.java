 * Ancestor class for wrappers that combine

 *
 * We need this combination because some methods are most convenient on
 * the view (eg, IntBuffer.get() is much better than ByteBuffer.getInt
 * because it reduces the chance of making mistakes with the index)
 * but sometimes you need the ByteBuffer too, for example, when sending
 * across the network.
